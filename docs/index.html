        <h1>Software Rasterizer</h1>
        <p>
            This is a simple 3D renderer (rasterizer) which is entirely software-based.
            This means all the calculations are done in JavaScript, without using WebGL or any other hardware acceleration
            or in other words, it runs on your processor (on a single core) instead of your graphics card.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't be fooled by the performance, graphics cards are designed to do this kind of work very efficiently
            and I am surprised how well this works in the browser. JavaScript is not known for its speed, but
            I was able to find some optimizations that make this work quite well, although with more time there would be
            a few things I could still improve.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is based on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU">wonderful video series from David Barr on YouTube</a>, although I've implemented some optimizations to make it run faster in the browser.
            This project was implemented with TypeScript and you can find the Code on <a href="https://github.com/nkappler/rasterizer">my GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <p>You can click inside the window to enable moving the camera with your Mouse and use different keyboard controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>W - Move forward</li>
            <li>S - Move backward</li>
            <li>A - Strafe left</li>
            <li>D - Strafe right</li>
            <li>Q - Move up</li>
            <li>E - Move down</li>
            <li>&rarr; &larr; &uarr; &darr; - Look around</li>
            <li>T - toggle render modes (Wireframe, untextured w/o depth buffer)</li>
            <li>B - toggle backface culling</li>
            <li>L - toggle Lighting</li>
            <li>H - Hide this text</li>
        </ul>
